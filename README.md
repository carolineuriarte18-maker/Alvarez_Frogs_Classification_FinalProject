# 🐸 Frogs Classification Project

## 📌 Project Description

This project is a **machine learning classification system** that identifies different frog species from images using a trained TensorFlow Lite model. It can be used in mobile apps, desktop apps, or embedded systems to classify frogs in real time. The repository includes the trained model, screenshots of classification results, and example outputs.  

## 🎯 Why This Project Was Created

This project was created to:
- Demonstrate the use of **TensorFlow Lite** for image classification tasks.
- Provide a lightweight model suitable for mobile and embedded platforms.
- Help users understand how machine learning can be applied to species recognition and biodiversity monitoring.
- Support educational and conservation-oriented tools by automating frog species identification.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

✔️ **TensorFlow Lite** – Model format and inference engine  
✔️ Python / ML Libraries – (for model evaluation and preprocessing)  
✔️ Firebase (optional) – For backend integration in app prototypes  
✔️ Image assets and model screenshots included for documentation and demo
